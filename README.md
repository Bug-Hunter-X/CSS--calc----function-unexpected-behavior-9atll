# CSS `calc()` Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function allows for dynamic calculations within CSS, but can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly or due to inconsistencies between different browsers.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` presents a possible solution and workarounds.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` (you'll need to create a simple HTML file with a `div` to test the CSS). 
3. Observe the unexpected behavior in different browsers if any.
4. Compare with the solution in `bugSolution.css`.
