To avoid unexpected behavior with `calc()`, ensure that:

1. **Units are consistent:**  Use the same unit type throughout the calculation (e.g., `calc(100% - 50px)`, not `calc(100% - 50)`).
2. **Whitespace is important:** Always use spaces around the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators (e.g., `calc(100% - 50px)`).
3. **Parent element width:** The calculation relies on the parent element's dimensions. Make sure the parent element's width is properly defined.  If it's dynamic, consider alternative approaches.
4. **Fallback:** Consider providing a fallback style that works in cases where `calc()` might not function as expected.

Here's a potential solution for the problem demonstrated in `bug.css`:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
  /* Fallback if calc() doesn't work well */
  min-width: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```
